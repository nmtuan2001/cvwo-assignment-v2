# cvwo-assignment-v2

This is the repository created by Nguyen Minh Tuan (A0223318M) as submissions for the assignments for Computing for Voluntary Welfare Organisations.

To run this:

    rails db:migrate

    heroku local -f Procfile.dev


I was unfamiliar with JSON API so I had to refer to a few sources while learning. This todo app is created with the help of the following guides: 
  + https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one#controllers
  + https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-two
